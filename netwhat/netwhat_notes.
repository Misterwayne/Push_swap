1 ) IP address

-Its the unique identifier on a network that use TCP/IP protocol

-There is two type of ip addresses IPV4 and IPV6

-IPV4 = it uses 32 binary bits, to express a 4 numbers separated by dots
 each number is the decimal of a 8 digit binary
ex : 216.27.61.137

-IPV6 = IPv6 uses 128 binary bits to create a single unique address on the network.
An IPv6 address is expressed by eight groups of hexadecimal (base-16) numbers separated by colons,
as in 2001:cdba:0000:0000:0000:0000:3257:9652.
Groups of numbers that contain all zeros are often omitted to save space
leaving a colon separator to mark the gap (as in 2001:cdba::3257:9652).

2) Netmask

-A Netmask is a 32-bit "mask" used to divide an IP address into subnets and specify the network's available hosts.
In a netmask, two bits are always automatically assigned. For example, in 255.255.225.0, "0" is the assigned network address.
In 255.255.255.255, "255" is the assigned broadcast address.
The 0 and 255 are always assigned and cannot be used.

-Netmask defines how "large" a network is or if you're configuring a rule that requires an IP address and a Netmask,
the Netmask will signify to what portion or range of the Network the rule will apply to

3) Network Class

Class A networks use a default subnet mask of 255.0.0.0 and have 0-127 as their first octet.
The address 10.52.36.11 is a class A address. Its first octet is 10, which is between 1 and 126, inclusive.

Class B networks use a default subnet mask of 255.255.0.0 and have 128-191 as their first octet.
The address 172.16.52.63 is a class B address.
Its first octet is 172, which is between 128 and 191, inclusive.

Class C networks use a default subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 and have 192-223 as their first octet.
The address 192.168.123.132 is a class C address.
Its first octet is 192, which is between 192 and 223, inclusive.

4)Subnetting

You should now be able to give IP addresses to 254 hosts.
This works fine if all 150 computers are on a single network.
However, your 150 computers are on three separate physical networks.
Instead of requesting more address blocks for each network,
you divide your network into subnets that enable you to use one block of addresses on multiple physical networks.

In this case, you divide your network into four subnets by using a subnet mask that makes the network address larger and the possible range of host addresses smaller.
In other words, you are 'borrowing' some of the bits usually used for the host address, and using them for the network portion of the address.
The subnet mask 255.255.255.192 gives you four networks of 62 hosts each.
This works because in binary notation, 255.255.255.192 is the same as 1111111.11111111.1111111.11000000.
The first two digits of the last octet become network addresses, so you get the additional networks 00000000 (0), 01000000 (64), 10000000 (128) and 11000000 (192).
(Some administrators will only use two of the subnetworks using 255.255.255.192 as a subnet mask.
In these four networks, the last 6 binary digits can be used for host addresses.

Using a subnet mask of 255.255.255.192, your 192.168.123.0 network
then becomes the four networks 192.168.123.0, 192.168.123.64, 192.168.123.128 and 192.168.123.192.
These four networks would have as valid host addresses:
 
   192.168.123.1-62
   192.168.123.65-126
   192.168.123.129-190
   192.168.123.193-254
